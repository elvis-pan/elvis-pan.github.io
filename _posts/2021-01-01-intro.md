Some facts about me:

- I was born in Beijing, China, and came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States for college when I was 18.
- "Yan"(言) is my given name and can mean "speak" or "language"; "Pan"(潘) is my family name. In Chinese, "Pan Yan" has the same pronounciation as the extreme sport "rock climbing" (but I'm bad at it). The meaning of this name is that my parents wish I could be "a master of both pen and sword."
- I graduated from the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China). I was admitted one year earlier than normal ("early development"), and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
- I am broadly interested in photography. I own a Sony α7R III camera. You can find some of my photography works on instagram, and I might upload some more shots to my website afterwards.
- I love listening to electronic music. My favorite genre is melodic dubstep, a melody-heavy subgenre of dubstep music. My favorite melodic dupstep artists are Illenium, Crystal Skies, and Seven Lions.
- My favorite sport is soccer. I am a passionate Real Madrid fan. My position is midfielder.
- I do competitive programming in college. However, when I first participated in competitive programming trainings at 12, I quitted after 2 months since it was too hard. After that I didn't do any competitive programming until I took [15-295](https://contest.cs.cmu.edu/295/f20/) at CMU.
- I am a fan of Vim. I use NeoVim and Vim mode in all of my IDEs.
