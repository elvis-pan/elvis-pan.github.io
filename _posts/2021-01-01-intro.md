Some facts about me:
- I was born in Beijing, China, and came to the United States for college when I was 18.
- I graduated from the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China), which is often ranked as the best high school in China.
- I am a photographer and am broadly interested in digital photography. You can find a collection of my photography works on [my website](https://elvis-pan.github.io/gallery/) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elvispanphoto/).
- I love listening to electronic music, and my favorite genre is melodic dubstep, a melody-heavy subgenre of dubstep music (see the music of Illenium, Seven Lions, and Au5). I also enjoy trance, future house, progressive house, and future bass.
- I am a passionate Real Madrid fan. I collected jerseys of Ronaldo, Modric, and Ramos.
- I enjoy fictions and movies like everyone do.
- I do competitive programming for fun in college [(my stats)](https://elvis-pan.github.io/projects/cp/). However, when I first encountered competitive programming at 12 and participated in the OI training of RDFZ, I quitted quickly after 2 months since it was too hard for me. After that I didn't do any competitive programming until I took [15-295](https://contest.cs.cmu.edu/295/f20/) at CMU.
- I am a fan of vim, and I use NeoVim and vim mode in all of my IDEs.
