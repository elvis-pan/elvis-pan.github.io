## Biography

I'm **Yan Pan**, or you can also call me **Elvis**.

In 2001, I was born in Beijing, China, where I have lived for 18 wonderful years.

In 2012, I was fortunately admitted to the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China) and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
At RDFZ, I further explored my interests in mathematics and computer science and met many great friends and teachers. 

In 2019, I graduated from RDFZ and went to [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States for college, where I major in computer science with concentrations in machine learning and computer graphics.
During college, I found my interests in the following areas:
- Deep Learning Theory
- (Non-) Convex Optimization
- Representation Learning
- Computational Photography and Computational Imaging
- Learning-based Computer Graphics and Computer Vision
- Theoretical Computer Science.

## Leisure Life
I enjoy photography, soccer, and electronic musics.
I am broadly interested in digital photography.
I believe that photography is the art of light and shadow, and I wish to find the beauty of light with my cameras.
You can find a collection of my photography works on [my website](https://elvis-pan.github.io/gallery/) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elvispanphoto/).

Music-wise, I'm especially into Melodic Dubstep, a melody-heavy subgenre of [Dubstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep) music.
Some of my favorite melodic dubstep artists include Illenium, Seven Lions, Au5, Nurko, MitiS, Crystal Skies, etc.
