Some facts about me:

- I was born in Beijing, China, and came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States for college when I was 18.
- "Yan"(言) is my given name and can mean "speak" or "language"; "Pan"(潘) is my family name. In Chinese, "Pan Yan" has the same pronounciation as the extreme sport "rock climbing" (but I'm bad at it). The meaning of this name is that my parents wish I could be "a master of both pen and sword."
- I graduated from the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China) for talented kids. I was admitted one year earlier than normal, and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
- I am broadly interested in photography. I own a Sony α7R III camera. You can find some of my photography works on instagram, and I might upload some more shots to my website afterwards.
- I love listening to electronic music. My favorite genres are melodic dubstep and uplifting trance.
- My favorite sport is soccer. I watch soccer games (Champions League, La Liga, Premier League) very often. My favorite soccer team is Real Madrid. I also play soccer myself every week.
- I do competitive programming sometimes in college. However, when I first participated in competitive programming trainings at 12, I quitted after 2 months since it was too hard.
- I am a fan of Vim. I use NeoVim and Vim mode in all of my IDEs.
