My background: I started taking casual Math Olympiad training starting from elementary school, so I have a pretty solid background in discrete math. No prior knowledge of college-level math, except basic calculus and matrix. Programming experiences are mostly in machine learning using Python or MATLAB, never done any systems programming or software engineering.

I plan to do a B.S. in CS, a machine learning concentration, a computer graphics concentration, and a mathematical sciences minor.

## Freshman
### Fall 2019
- 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation
- &#9733; 21-127 Concepts of Mathematics
  - A very interesting introduction to many areas in mathematics, especially those related to computer science.
  - The course overed a broad number of areas, mainly discrete mathematics, including algebra, real analysis, number theory, combinatorics.
  - It introduced formal definition of mathematical objects as well as practiced proof-writing skills, which would be crucial for math and CS.
  - I was quite unhappy for not taking 21-128/15-151, but my professor Greggo tends to add more stuff so it's almost the same as 128 or 151.
- 21-259 Calculus in Three Dimensions
  - Extremely easy. I got 101/100 for the final grade, full score on all midterms plus many bonus points.
  - I would really recommend taking some time to consider the courses before you take them.
- &#9733; 66-107 Modeling Complex Systems
  - Amazing area. I actually learned computational social science in college, which is the reason I took this course.
  - The professor John Miller is really nice. He knows pretty much about a vast number of topics in social sciences.
  - Due to my previous experience, I taught the whole class how to program in NetLogo as well as helped debugging their programs. Free TA :)
  - Worked on a project that simulates the dynamics of social gatherings.
- 76-100 Reading and Writing in Academic Context
  - Just a course for international students.

Overall: light

### Spring 2020
- &#9733; 15-150 Principles of Functional Programming
- &#9733; &#9733;&#9724; 15-251 Great Ideas in Theoretical Computer Science
  - My favorite course so far at CMU, which is quite surprising given the amount of time I spent on this course and the pressure it once brought me.
  - The course is being notorious due to its massive workload, the conceptual difficulty for freshman students, and the pressure in writing sessions and exams.
  - There were many topics covered, including DFA, turing machines, undecidability, complexity theory, algorithms (randomized/approximation), graph theory, cryptography.
  - The course is the main reason that I decided to choose computer science as my degree.
  - The professor Anil Ada is really nice! He really cares about his students and is enthusiatic towards teaching and improving his course contents. 
- 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations
- 21-270 Introduction to Mathematical Finance
- 76-101 Interpretation and Argument

Overall: medium-heavy, spent most time on 251.

### Summer 2020
- &#9733;&#9724; 15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems
  - Great introductory course to computer systems.
  - Not hard to get an A since the labs weights 50%, but the final exam is extremely hard, especially those questions about concurrency.
  - The labs can be very time consuming.
- 21-325 Probability
  - Much harder than I expected, quite fast-paced.
  - Heavily based on mathematical analysis, better take 21-269 or 21-355 beforehand. 
  - The take-home exam felt like a Putnam competition. In fact, the first problem on the final is from past Putnams. Definitely not related to the homeworks.

## Sophomore
### Fall 2020
- 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learning (PhD)
  - Don't be fooled by the "PhD" in the title. Only 30% are PhD students. Most people are masters or undergraduates, and the background of students vary significantly, ranging from doing ML research to not knowing the Bayes rule.
  - The grading is friendly, 50% of the students get curved to an A. The final exam was not easy, but they did it intentionally to select the top performing students. It's almost entirely based on the exam, so don't get too anxious about this course if you're taking it as an undergraduate student like me.
  - We did a project on music generation, pretty cool topic.
  - In general, quite disappointing. I should have taken 15-462 Computer Graphics in this semester (with Keenan Crane), but since I was afraid of the pressure of 10-701 I didn't take it and took real analysis instead. Awful choice.
- &#9733; 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms
- 21-355 Principles of Real Analysis
- 79-104 Global Histories
- 15-295 Competition Programming and Problem Solving

Overall: medium-light, almost wasted a semester. Most pressure came from the anxiety of doing nothing.

## Spring 2021
- 10-725 Convex Optimization
- 15-462 Computer Graphics
- 16-385 Computer Vision
- 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference
- 85-219 Biological Foundations of Behavior
- 15-295 Competition Programming and Problem Solving
- Tsinghua University

Other commitment: ML Research @ MultiComp Lab
