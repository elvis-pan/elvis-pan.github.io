I'm **Yan Pan**, or you can also call me **Elvis**.

I was born in Beijing, China, where I have lived for 18 wonderful years.
I was admitted to the Early Development Program of [The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](http://www.rdfz.cn/en/) one year earlier than normal, and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
At RDFZ, I further explored my interests in mathematics and computer science and met many great friends and teachers.
Then, I went to [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) for college, where I major in computer science with concentrations in machine learning and computer graphics.
During college, I found my interests in the following areas:
- Deep Learning Theory
- (Non-) Convex Optimization
- Representation Learning
- Computational Photography
- Theoretical Computer Science.

With the passion to make my own contributions to these areas, I plan to apply to PhD programs in 2023 and become a researcher.
However, in the meantime I need to work hard to build up my knowledge and skills for research.

Besides school, I enjoy photography, soccer, and electronic musics.

You can find a collection of my photography works on [my website](https://elvis-pan.github.io/gallery/) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elvispanphoto/).
I am broadly interested in digital photography, especially landscape photography.
I believe that photography is the art of light and shadow, and I wish to find the beauty of light with my cameras.

Some of my favorite musics recently:
- Seven Lions - Silent Skies (feat. Karra)
- Matisse & Sadko - Into You (feat. Hanne Mj&oslash;en)
- Ti&euml;sto & Don Diablo - Chemicals (feat. Thomas Troelsen)
- Martin Garrix & Matisse & Sadko - Together
