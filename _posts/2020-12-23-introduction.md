I'm **Yan Pan**, and people also call me **Elvis**.

I was born in Beijing, China.
I went to the Early Development Program of [The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](http://www.rdfz.cn/en/) and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
Then, I went to [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) for college, where I major in computer science with concentrations in machine learning and computer graphics.

During school, I found my interests in the following academic areas.
- Deep Learning Theory
- (Non-) Convex Optimization
- Representation Learning
- Computational Photography

Besides school, I enjoy photography, soccer, and electronic musics.
You can find a collection of my photography works on [my website](https://elvis-pan.github.io/gallery/) or [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elvispanphoto/).
I am generally interested in landscape photography and art photography.
