- I was born in Beijing, China, and came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States for college when I was 18.
- I graduated from the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China) for talented kids. I was admitted one year earlier than normal, and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
- I am very interested in photography. I own a Sony Î±7R III camera. You can find some of my photography works on instagram, and I might upload some more shots to my website afterwards.
- I love listening to electronic music and my favorite genres are melodic dubstep and uplifting trance. By the way, electronic music is not just the loud and boring music at the clubs! [This is real electronic music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw3c6rr8-mU)
- My favorite sport is soccer. I watch soccer games (Champions League, La Liga, Premier League) very often. My favorite soccer team is Real Madrid. I play soccer almost every week.
