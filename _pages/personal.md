- I was born in Beijing, China, and came to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States for college when I was 18.
- I graduated from the Early Development Program of the [High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China (RDFZ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Affiliated_to_Renmin_University_of_China) for talented kids. I was admitted one year earlier than normal, and spent 7 years there for both middle school and high school.
- I am very interested in photography. I own a Sony Î±7R III camera. You can find some of my photography works on instagram, and I might upload some more shots to my website afterwards.
- I love listening to electronic music, especially melody-heavy ones. My favorite genres are melodic dubstep (Seven Lions, Illenium, Crystal Skies...) and progressive/uplifting trance (Armin van Buuren, Aly & Fila, Solarstone, Gareth Emery...). [(This is trance)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw3c6rr8-mU)
- My favorite sport is soccer. I watch soccer games (Champions League, La Liga, Premier League) very often. My favorite soccer team is Real Madrid. I play soccer almost every week.
