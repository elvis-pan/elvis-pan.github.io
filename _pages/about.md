Hi! I'm a sophomore student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) majoring in computer science.
I am interested in the theory and applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Currently, I work at [CMU MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/) and [Paul Liang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pliang/), where I research multimodal multitask machine learning. This semester, I'm visiting [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) as an exchange student from February to June.

For more information about my [CV](https://panyan7.github.io/cv/), [projects](https://panyan7.github.io/projects/), [courses](https://panyan7.github.io/blog/2021/courses/) and [life](https://panyan7.github.io/blog/2021/intro/), feel free to explore this webpage.
