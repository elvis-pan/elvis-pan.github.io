I'm a sophomore student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) majoring in computer science.
My research interest is in machine learning and optimization.

Currently, I do research at [CMU MultiComp Lab](http://multicomp.cs.cmu.edu/) under [Dr. Louis-Philippe Morency](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~morency/). This semester, I'm visiting [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) from February to July.
