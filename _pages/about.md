My name is *Yan Pan*, or *Elvis*.
I'm a sophomore student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) [School of Computer Science](https://cs.cmu.edu) majoring in computer science with minors in machine learning and mathematics.
I'm interested in the theoretical foundations of machine learning, optimization, and the application of machine learning in computer vision and computer graphics.
