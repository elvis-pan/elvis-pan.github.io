This is our final project for CMU's [10-701 Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10701-20/).
We implemented the LSTM-RBM model in PyTorch for chord pitch generation and additional LSTM layer for chord duration generation.
You can view the code for this project on [GitHub](https://github.com/elvis-pan/music-lstm-rbm).

### Notes on Dataset
The midi-version musics of some popular classical music composers can be downloaded from [Classical Piano Midi Page](http://www.piano-midi.de/midicoll.htm).
We would suggest using songs of the same instrument, and if possible the same composer, in order to get good results.

### My Contributions
In this project, I was responsible for all the design and implementation of the model in PyTorch.
